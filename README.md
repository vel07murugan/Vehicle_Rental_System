# Vehicle_Rental_System
This is a console-based Vehicle Rental System built in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
It allows customers to sign up, log in, rent vehicles, return them, and view their rentals.

The project demonstrates Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism in a real-world application.
