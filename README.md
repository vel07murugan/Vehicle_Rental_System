# Vehicle_Rental_System
The Vehicle Rental System is a console-based Java application that provides a simple platform for managing vehicle rentals. The system is built with a clear separation of roles, where admins can add, modify, delete, and monitor vehicles, while borrowers can sign up, log in, view available vehicles, and rent them. It ensures security deposit checks before rentals and restricts users from renting more than one car or bike at the same time. The system also supports generating useful reports such as listing vehicles by rental price, searching vehicles by name or type, and identifying vehicles that require servicing.

This project demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming principles such as inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation, along with the effective use of Javaâ€™s Collections Framework and Stream API for handling data efficiently. It also provides a foundation for future enhancements like integrating payment systems, vehicle return and damage tracking, and database connectivity. Overall, the project highlights problem-solving, logical thinking, and the ability to design real-world applications in Java.
